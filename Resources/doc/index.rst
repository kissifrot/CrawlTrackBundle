CrawlTrackBundle
================

Setup and Configuration
-----------------------

First, install the bundle with Composer:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ composer require webdl/composer require webdl/crawltrack-bundle

If everything worked, the ``WebDL/CrawltrackBundle`` can now be found
at ``webdl/crawltrack-bundle``.
